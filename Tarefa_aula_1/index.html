    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. These are the languages of the web.</p>

    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>

    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Wordpress or Wix</li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
